# A collection of offline single-file educational contents. 

No CDNs nor iframes, every asset is inlined in the html file.


Note: Any offline html files for unity will be very large! Use chunks.py if you're having trouble loading it. You can use https://github.com/CoolDude2349/schoolworkforall/blob/main/code-inputer2.html or https://github.com/CoolDude2349/schoolworkforall/blob/main/khanacademy/code-input-khan.html for loading the chunks.
